# applied-ML

#### NOTE: This repo has the assignment solutions to the UBC CPSC 330 course. This course focuses on applying ML models on datasets instead of implementation of algorithms. We mostly used sci-kit learn, SHAP, and other tool(kits) for this course. All rights are reserved to the course and course instructor.
